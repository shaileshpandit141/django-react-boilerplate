# Django and React Boilerplate with JWT Authentication

This project is a boilerplate for setting up a web application using Django for the backend with JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication, and React for the frontend.

## Features

- Django backend with custom user model (using username, email)
- JWT Authentication for all actions
- React frontend setup with Create React App
- Integration between Django and React

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- npm (or yarn)
- PostgreSQL (or another preferred database)

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup (Django)

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

    ```plaintext
    SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
    DEBUG=True
    ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
    CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
    ```

5. **Apply migrations:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6. **Create a superuser:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

7. **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

### Frontend Setup (React)

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the React development server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### Configuration


### Performing Authentication Actions API's

**Registration**:
- Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/registration/` with user details (username, email, password1, password2).

**Login**:
- Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/token/` with email and password to get access and refresh tokens.

**Logout**:
- Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/logout/` to log out the user and blacklist the refresh token.

**Password Reset**:
- Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/password/reset/` with the userâ€™s email.

**Password Reset Verification**:
- Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/password/reset/confirm/` with the new password and token received from the email.

**Email Verification**:
- Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/registration/verify-email/` with the verification key received in the email.
  
**Re Email Verification**:
- Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/resend-verification/` with the verification key received in the email.

**Token Refresh**:
- Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/token/refresh/` with the refresh token to get a new access token.

**Access a protected endpoint for test**:
- Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/protected/` with the refresh token to get a new access token.

    ```
    POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/password/reset/confirm/
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
    "uid": "uid_from_email",

    "detail": "ok"
    }
    ```

- **Frontend:**

    The React frontend should handle authentication by storing the JWT tokens in localStorage or a similar mechanism and including the access token in the Authorization header for protected requests.
