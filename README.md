# Django and React Boilerplate with JWT Authentication

This project is a boilerplate for setting up a web application using Django for the backend with JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication, and React for the frontend.

## Features

- Django backend with custom user model (using username, email)
- JWT Authentication for all actions
- React frontend setup with Create React App
- Integration between Django and React

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- npm (or yarn)
- PostgreSQL (or another preferred database)

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup (Django)

1. **Clone the repository:**

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
  cd your-repo-name
  ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**

  Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

  ```plaintext
  HOST=localhost
  PORT=8000
  SEND_VERIFICATION_URL_HOST=localhost
  SEND_VERIFICATION_URL_PORT=3000
  SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
  DEBUG=True
  ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,
  CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,

  # Uncomment and configure the following for PostgreSQL:
  # DB_NAME=your_db_name
  # DB_USER=your_db_user
  # DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
  # DB_HOST=localhost
  # DB_PORT=5432

  # Email Configuration
  EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend
  EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
  EMAIL_PORT=587
  EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
  EMAIL_USE_SSL=False
  EMAIL_HOST_USER=your_email@example.com
  EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your_email_password
  DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
  ```

5. **Apply migrations:**

  ```bash
  python manage.py migrate
  ```

6. **Create a superuser:**

  ```bash
  python manage.py createsuperuser
  ```

7. **Run the development server:**

  ```bash
  python manage.py runserver
  ```

### Frontend Setup (React)

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

  ```bash
  cd frontend
  ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

  Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

  ```plaintext
  HOST=localhost
  PORT=3000
  REACT_APP_BASE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/
  ```
  Note: `HOST` name is same as backend `HOST` name.

4. **Run the React development server:**

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

### Configuration


### Performing Authentication Actions API's

- **Registration**:
Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/signup/` with user details (username, email, password1, password2).

- **Login**:
Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/token/` with email and password to get access and refresh tokens.

- **Logout**:
Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/logout/` to log out the user and blacklist the refresh token.

- **Password Reset**:
Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/password/reset/` with the userâ€™s email.

- **Password Reset Verification**:
Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/password/reset/confirm/` with the new password and token received from the email.

- **Email Verification**:
Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/signup/verify-email/` with the verification key received in the email.

- **Re Email Verification**:
Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/resend-verification/` with username to get key received in the email.

- **Token Refresh**:
Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/token/refresh/` with the refresh token to get a new access token.

- **Access the user**:
Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/user/` with the access token to get a userInfo.

- **Access a protected endpoint for test**:
Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/api/auth/protected/` with the access token to get a protected route data.


### API's Usages using .rest file

  ```

**Refresh JWT tokens:**
```
POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/token/refresh/

**Frontend:**

The React frontend should handle authentication by storing the JWT tokens in localStorage or a similar mechanism and including the access token in the Authorization header for protected requests.
